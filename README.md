# Librarian ðŸ“–

Who is this repository for?
This repository is for anyone who wants to easily access information from their documents and find answers to their questions with citations. It is particularly helpful for researchers, students, and anyone who works with large amounts of text data.
Why did I make this repository?
I made this repository because I was tired of spending hours searching through documents and manually finding citations for my research. I wanted to create a tool that would make it easier for me and others to access and analyze information from text documents.
I am also interested in the potential of large language models like GPT-3 to revolutionize the way we interact with information. I believe that Librarian can be a valuable tool for anyone who wants to harness the power of AI to improve their research and learning workflows.
